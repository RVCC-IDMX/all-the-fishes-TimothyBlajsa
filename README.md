# The Surreal Aquarium
------------------------
## Overview
USING PIXI JS
This is a simple application featuring a stage, various sprites, and animations, compiled to form an aesthetic surreal aquarium scene

Sprites include...
- a fish tank background
- a betta fish
- a small fish
- a large fish
- school of fish
- a minnow fish
- coral
- kelp
- bubble

The various sprites are animated along both sine and cosine waves in order to create movement in the scene

The minnow fish acts as a player sprite in which a function allows it to follow the user mouse on screen

## Author Testimony
This experience, being my first time using PIXIJS, was overall very smooth. Following the tutorial was enough to give me the basic toolset to inspire a full scene. I was able to achieve the resulting scene with what was taught in the tutorial. There were no problems during this process, just general troubleshooting anf finetuning individual elements, until I was satisfied with the end product. In addition, I was able to work around certain things, such as a translation movement by adjusting the values of the sine wave, thus giving the appearance of a horizontal movement. 

While the scene is good as is, to make it feel more interactive, the added function of having a player sprite follow the user mouse was put in; this was relatively simple, setting a function in which the new position of the sprite is the position of the mouse.
